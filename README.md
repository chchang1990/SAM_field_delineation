# Leveraging Segment-Anything Model (SAM) to delineate crop fields from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery

This script delineates the crop field boundaries on S2 imagery by using the <i>segment-geospatial</i> Python package developed by Prof. Qiusheng Wu at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The <i>segment-geospatial</i> package utilizes Meta's Segment-Anything Model (SAM) to generate segmented masks for different features on a remote sensing imagery as separated polygons, and thus can be applied to delineate the crop field boundaries.
